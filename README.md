# Coffee Machine

**Stage 2: (ongoing)**

_**Description**<br>
Now let's consider a case where you need a lot of coffee. Maybe, for example, you’re hosting a party with a lot of guests. The program should calculate how much water, coffee beans, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee. One cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans._

_The user should input the amount of coffee he needs, in cups, for all the guests._

_Of course, all this coffee is not needed right now, so at this stage, the coffee machine doesn’t actually make any coffee._

_**Instruction**<br>
Write a program that calculates the amount of ingredients needed to make a certain amount of coffee._

**Stage 1:**

_**Description**<br>
Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. But in this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffee beans, it can make different varieties of coffee, and it can take the money for making a coffee._

_The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It prints to the standard output what it is doing as it makes a coffee._

_**Instruction**<br>
Write a program that prints the steps necessary to make coffee._
